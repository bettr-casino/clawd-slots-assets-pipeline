## Primary Goal

Reverse engineer CLEOPATRA slots from YouTube videos of real Las Vegas slot machines to understand the game mechanics, reel structure, symbols, and special features.

## Research Steps

### Step 1: Video Shortlist Creation
- Build a shortlist of maximum 5 high-quality CLEOPATRA gameplay videos from YouTube
- Focus on videos showing real Las Vegas casino machines
- Prioritize videos with:
  - Clear reel visibility
  - Multiple spin sequences
  - Bonus feature demonstrations
  - Good audio/visual quality
  - Complete game rounds

### Step 2: User Selection via Telegram
- Send a Telegram message to Ron with the shortlist
- Include video titles, links, and brief descriptions
- Ask Ron to pick one video by replying with a number (1-5)
- Wait for Ron's selection before proceeding

### Step 3: Video Analysis
Once Ron selects a video, analyze it to extract:
- **Reel Configuration**: Number of reels, rows, and positions
- **Symbol Set**: Complete list of unique symbols including:
  - Base game symbols
  - Wild symbols
  - Scatter symbols
  - Special symbols
  - Bonus trigger symbols
- **Game Mechanics**: 
  - Payline structure
  - Win calculation methods
  - Base game features
  - Bonus game triggers and mechanics
  - Special features (free spins, multipliers, etc.)

### Step 4: Documentation
- Save all findings in MEMORY.md
- Include:
  - Reel size and configuration
  - Complete symbol inventory with descriptions
  - Game mechanics and rules
  - Bonus features and triggers
  - Any unique or special gameplay elements
  - Screenshots or timestamps for reference

### Step 5: Clarification Protocol
- If anything is unclear or stuck during research
- Ask Ron for clarification via Telegram
- Provide specific questions with context
- Continue with other researchable aspects while waiting

## Heartbeat Protocol

Every 30 minutes, send a Telegram progress summary with exactly 2 sentences:

**Format:**
```
Last 30 mins I worked on <short summary of what was done>.
Next 30 mins I am working on <short summary of the next planned step>.
```

**Example:**
```
Last 30 mins I worked on building a shortlist of 5 CLEOPATRA gameplay videos from YouTube.
Next 30 mins I am working on sending the shortlist to Ron via Telegram and waiting for his selection.
```

## Success Criteria

- Complete video shortlist created and approved by Ron
- Selected video thoroughly analyzed
- All game mechanics documented in MEMORY.md
- Regular 30-minute progress updates sent to Ron via Telegram
- Any blockers or unclear items communicated promptly
