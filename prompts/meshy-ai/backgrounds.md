## Style Guidelines

- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or wider for slots
- **Depth**: Create sense of depth without cluttering
- **Color Palette**: Warm golds, oranges, cool blues for contrast
- **Lighting**: Dramatic but not too dark
- **Detail Level**: Rich but not distracting from symbols
- **Performance**: Keep draw calls low, use baked lighting

## Technical Requirements
- Support portrait and landscape orientations
- Parallax layers for depth effect
- Animated elements on separate layers
- Mobile optimization critical
- File formats: PNG (backgrounds), FBX (3D elements)

## Integration Notes
- Import backgrounds as planes in Unity
- Use Unity's Particle System for effects
- Consider multiple variants for visual variety
- Test readability with symbols overlaid
- Ensure sufficient contrast for UI elements
